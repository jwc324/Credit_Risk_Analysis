# Credit_Risk_Analysis
Module 17

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

This module assesses various machine learning models to assess the provided, which describes credit risk. There is also a balancing exercise for the chosen model.

## Results: Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.



| Sampling    | Accuracy Score | High Risk | Low Risk |
| ----------- | ----------- | -------- | ------- | 
| Naive Random| 64.03%       | 0.01 | 1.00 |
| SMOTE Oversampling   | 65.14%        | 0.01 | 1.00 |


## Summary: Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
